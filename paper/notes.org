* Key sharing 

1. Can a market place deny vendors their feedback data by removing the
   S_v from the system?
   1. No. This is because the public key P_v is available at vendor's
      location and this is the key signed/certified by marketplace's
      certification key
      1. Marketplace has to store a root certification key at a well
         known location /.well-known/feedback_certification_key
2. What happens if the marketplace loses the certification key or
   shuts down and stops hosting the certification key?
   1. All the vendors will lost their ratings and reviews history. We
      can't have this nonsense.
3. What other bad things can the marketplace do by changing the P_v?
4. Add a section about revocation of vendor encryption and signing
   keys
5. Popr includes ipfs location of the public key used to verify that
   the vendor signed the request or the marketplace did it on vendor's
   behalf
6. This key is the public key that market place generated for the
   vendor
7. And it is saved in the same ipns location as the P_ve
8. This way we don't send any private keys around + mktplace can't
   take away the public key needed to validate popr
9. We will need separate keys fur each marketplace and for P2P
   payments
10. We will need the vendor to sign the public key - but by saving it
    in his ipns the vendor is certifying it!
